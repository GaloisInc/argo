Remote Interaction for SAW and Cryptol
--------------------------------------

This repository contains servers that implement APIs for interacting
remotely with SAW and Cryptol. These APIs are realized as JSON-RPC_
protocols, and they can be used either over stdio or a socket.

.. _JSON-RPC: https://www.jsonrpc.org/specification

Both protocols are built on a common foundation. The specific actions
available for SAW or Cryptol are, however, different. This document is
divided into three main sections: one about the common protocol, one
about the Cryptol-specific interaction commands, and one about the
SAW-specific commands.

Overall Protocol Structure
==================

The interaction protocols are designed primarily to support
interactive, rather than batch mode, use of SAW. SAW is a stateful
system: LLVM, JVM, and Cryptol modules are loaded, and then proofs are
carried out in the resulting context. Each step can consume
significant time and computing resources, so it is best to avoid
needless repetition of steps. Additionally, a step might fail, and
recovering from that failure may require backtracking an arbitrary
number of steps.

To minimize the necessary amount of recomputation when backtracking
and exploring alternative proof strategies, the server performs
extensive caching. When a client issues a command, they additionally
provide a representation of the state in which the command is to be
performed; when the server has performed the command, it returns a new
state along with the result. Clients may re-use server states as many
times as they desire.

Explicitly representing the state in the protocol has additional
benefits. The server can be restarted at any time, with the worst
consequence being a delay in its response. The client can maintain its
own handle into the server state, persist it to disk, and pick up
where it left off on another computer.


Transport
~~~~~~~~~

The JSON-RPC messages in the protocol are encoded in netstrings_, to
make it easier to allocate buffers ahead of time and to avoid bugs
with missing terminator characters.

.. _netstrings: http://cr.yp.to/proto/netstrings.txt

The servers support two modes of operation: stdio and sockets.

State
~~~~~

According to the JSON-RPC specification, the ``"params"`` field in a
message object must be an array or object. In this protocol, it is
always an object. While each message may specify its own arguments,
every message has a parameter field named ``"state"``.

When the first message is sent from the client to the server, the
``"state"`` parameter should be initialized to the empty JSON array
``[]``. Replies from the server contain a new state that should be
used in subsequent requests, so that state changes executed by the
request are visible.

While the state representations returned from the server presently
have a predictable relationship to the commands that gave rise to
them, their precise structure is considered an implementation detail
that could change at any time. Please treat them as opaque tokens that
may be saved and re-used, but not created by the client directly.


Cryptol

Calling Functions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Note: this method may be removed in the future, because its abilities
have been subsumed by ``"evaluate expression"``.

This method applies a Cryptol function to some arguments. The type of

Datatypes
~~~~~~~~~

JSON Cryptol Expressions
________________________


In the API, Cryptol expressions can be represented by the following:

JSON Booleans
  Represent the corresponding Cryptol Booleans

JSON Integers
  Cryptol integer literals, that can be used at a variety of types

JSON Strings
  Cryptol concrete syntax

JSON Objects
  Objects can represent a variety of Cryptol expressions. The field
  ``"expression"`` contains a tag that can be used to determine the
  remaining fields.

The tag values in objects are:

``"bits"``
  The expression is a bitvector. Further fields are:

  ``"encoding"``
    Either ``"base64"`` or ``"hex"``, for base-64 or hexadecimal
    representations of the bitvector

  ``"data"``
    A string containing the actual data

  ``"width"``
    An integer: the bit-width of the represented bit vector

``"record"``
  The expression is a record. The field ``"record data"`` is a JSON
  object that maps record field names to JSON Cryptol expressions.

``"sequence"``
  The expression is a sequence. The field ``"sequence"`` contains a
  JSON array of the elements of the sequence; each is a JSON Cryptol
  expression.

``"tuple"``
  The expression is a tuple. The field ``"tuple"`` contains a JSON
  array of the elements of the tuple; each is a JSON Cryptol
  expression.

``"unit"``
  The expression is the unit constructor, and there are no further fields.

``"let"``
  The expression is a ``where`` binding. The fields are:

  ``"binders"``
    A list of binders. Each binder is an object with two fields:
    ``"name"`` is a string that is the name to be bound, and
    ``"definition"`` is a JSON Cryptol expression.

  ``"body"``
    A JSON Cryptol expression in which the bound names may be used.

``"call"``
  The expression is a function application. Further fields are
  ``"function"`` and ``"arguments"``. The former contains a JSON
  Cryptol expression; the latter contains a JSON array of expressions.
  


JSON Cryptol Types
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

JSON representations of types are type schemas. A type schema has
three fields:

``"forall"``

  Contains an array of objects. Each object has two fields: ``"name"``
  is the name of a type variable, and ``"kind"`` is its kind. There
  are four kind formers: the string ``"Type"`` represents ordinary
  datatypes, the string ``"Num"`` is the kind of numbers, and
  ``"Prop"`` is the kind of propositions. Arrow kinds are represented
  by objects in which the field ``"kind"`` is the string ``"arrow"``,
  and the fields ``"from"`` and ``"to"`` are the kinds on the left and
  right side of the arrow, respectively.

``"propositions"``
  A JSON array of the constraints in the type.

``"type"``
  The type in which the variables from ``"forall"`` are in scope and
  the constraints in ``"propositions"`` are in effect.

Concrete Types
______________

Types are represented as JSON objects. The ``"type"`` field contains one of the following tags:

``"variable"``
  The type is a type variable. The remaining fields are ``"name"``,
  which contains the variable's name, and ``"kind"``, which contains
  its kind (represented as in the ``"forall"`` section).

``"record"``
  The type is a record type. The remaining field is ``"fields"``,
  which contains a JSON object whose keys are the names of fields and
  whose values are the fields' types.

``"number"``
  The type is a number. The field ``"value"`` contains the number
  itself.

``"inf"``
  The type is the infinite number. There are no further fields.

``"Bit"``
  The type is the bit type. There are no further fields.

``"Integer"``
  The type is the integer type. There are no further fields.

``"Z"``
  The type is integers modulo another value. The field ``"modulus"``
  contains the modulus, which is a type.

``"bitvector"``
  The type is a bitvector. The field ``"width"`` contains the number
  of bits, which is a type.

``"sequence"``
  The type is a sequence. The field ``"length"`` contains the length
  of the sequence (a type), and the field ``"contents"`` contains the
  type of entries in the sequence.

``"function"``
  The type is a function type. The fields ``"domain"`` and ``"range"``
  contain the domain and range types.

``"unit"``
  The type is the unit type. There are no further fields.

``"tuple"``
  The type is a tuple. The field ``"contents"`` is a JSON array
  containing the types of the projections from the tuple.

One of ``"+"``, ``"-"``, ``"*"``, ``"/"``, ``"%"``, ``"^^"``, ``"width"``, ``"min"``, ``"max"``, ``"/^"``, ``"%^"``, ``"lengthFromThenTo"``
  The type is an application of the indicated type function. The
  arguments are contained in the ``"arguments"`` field, as a JSON
  array.

Propositions
____________

Propositions/constraints have the key ``"prop"``, mapped to one of the
following tags:

``"=="``
  Equality. The equated terms are in the ``"left"`` and ``"right"``
  fields.

``"!="``
  Inequality. The disequated terms are in the ``"left"`` and
  ``"right"`` fields.

``">="``
  Greater than. The greater type is in the ``"greater"`` field and the
  lesser type is in the ``"lesser"`` field.

``"fin"``
  Finitude. The finite type is in the ``"subject"`` field.

``"has"``
  The selector is in the ``"selector"`` field, the type that has this
  selector is in the ``"type"`` field, and the type expected for the
  projection is in the ``"is"`` field.

``"Arith"``, ``"Cmp"``, ``"SignedCmp"``, ``"Zero"``, ``"Logic"``
  The type that has these operations defined is in the ``"subject"``
  field.
